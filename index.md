# Hi, I'm Emma Hunt

I am a software engineer passionate about user experience, HCI, and CS education. Currently working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft.

## Who I am
### Love of User Experience Design
I believe that a good user interface design is invisible. Anything less becomes cumbersome as user must work harder to overcome the subpar experience. It is the responsibility of both engineers and designers to ensure that software fades into the background allowing users to focus on their task. More than once as a student I changed my major between computer science and graphic design as I tried to create the user experience degree that my university lacked. I am always fighting to be closer to the end user, to understand their needs and build a product that works intuitively for them. I want to be both an engineer and a designer. I want a job where I get to build and design the user interface, with the customer at the center, where user research is core.

### Volunteer Teacher
I love teaching. There is nothing more fun than teaching students a new concept and watching them run with it. I have spent extensive time volunteering as a student teacher and tutor, and continue to love the field of education.

I am a graduate of International School in Bellevue, WA. As part of the graduation requirements, I was required to complete a year long capstone project. I wrote an introductory computer science curriculum combining coding projects with interactive classroom activities. I taught this curriculum to a group of 25 middle school students in a weeklong class for their annual vocational credit. My curriculum “Click, Clack, Cool”, is available for download and free use at https://github.com/emma-hunt/ClickClackCool_CSCurriculum. 

As a senior in college, I worked with United Way of Provo, a community center serving an area with low access to internet. I helped to implement their first after school computer science program. Using a modified version of the curriculum I wrote in high school, I built an after school computer science program for elementary and middle school students. Introductory CS topics were supplemented with introductory math and internet safety lessons. For 3 months, I ran a pilot of this course for a group of 2nd through 8th graders. 

### Education and Diversity
I am extremely invested in computer science education. When I was a junior in high school, my school offered their first computer science class. Despite growing up in the Seattle area, I had never considered a career in tech. I quickly fell in love the problem solving and attention to detail CS requires. But without that initial exposure in school, I likely never would have taken a computer science course in college, let alone majored in CS. Early CS education sets students up for success as they learn problem solving skills relevant in the modern tech centered world. It also provides critical exposure to minority students in the field. CS classes are taught in more schools in the United States each year, and a more diverse set of students take the AP CS test. But there are still areas where computer science is out of reach.
